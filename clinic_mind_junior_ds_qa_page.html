        <p class="question">1. Describe your experience with SQL. Include any examples of queries, data cleaning, or analysis tasks you have performed.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <div class="answer">
          I have used SQL extensively for data exploration, cleaning, and feature preparation in analytics and machine learning projects. Typical work includes writing joins across multiple tables, using <code>GROUP BY</code>, window functions, and conditional logic for aggregations, and filtering noisy records before modeling.<br /><br />
          For example, I have:
          <ul>
            <li>Joined transactional and dimension tables to create analysis-ready datasets for forecasting and reporting.</li>
            <li>Created summary tables (daily/weekly aggregates) using window functions to compute rolling averages, lags, and growth metrics.</li>
            <li>Performed data quality checks with <code>COUNT</code>, <code>DISTINCT</code>, and outlier checks to identify missing, duplicated, or inconsistent records before sending the data into Python pipelines.</li>
          </ul>
          In my recent work, SQL sits alongside Python (pandas) as part of the end-to-end workflow for extracting, cleaning, and validating data prior to modeling.

      <div class="content">
        <div class="answer">
          While I have not yet used Amazon QuickSight specifically, I do have experience with BI and dashboard-style reporting using tools like Excel, Google Data Studio/Looker Studio, and Python-based dashboards.
          I have built:
          <ul>
            <li>Interactive views of model performance and error metrics so stakeholders can understand where a model performs well or poorly.</li>
            <li>Trend dashboards showing time-series behavior (for example, consumption or activity over time) with filters by segment or time window.</li>
          </ul>
          I am comfortable designing clear visual narratives (KPIs, trends, breakdowns), and I am confident I can quickly learn and adopt QuickSight, given my experience with SQL-backed reporting and visualization.

      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <div class="answer">
          I follow a structured process:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Source & schema checks:</strong> Confirm table definitions, data types, and primary/foreign keys; verify that I understand how the data is generated.</li>
            <li><strong>Sanity checks:</strong> Use SQL and Python (pandas) to check row counts, distinct keys, null distributions, and basic statistics to spot obvious anomalies.</li>
            <li><strong>Business-rule validation:</strong> Verify that values make sense in context (for example, no negative counts where impossible, timestamps in valid ranges).</li>
            <li><strong>Outlier and duplication checks:</strong> Identify outliers and duplicate records, and either correct, cap, or exclude them based on agreed rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Reproducible cleaning pipeline:</strong> Implement the cleaning logic in reusable code (SQL scripts or Python functions) so the same steps run consistently for new data.</li>
            <li><strong>Spot checks and peer review:</strong> Compare sample records before and after processing and, when possible, review assumptions with a domain expert or teammate.</li>
          </ol>
          This combination of technical checks and business validation helps keep the data consistent and trustworthy for analysis.

          Yes, I have worked with large datasets both in industry and in academic projects. The main challenges were memory limits, slower query times, and ensuring that intermediate steps remained efficient.
          <br /><br />
          To handle this, I typically:
          <ul>
            <li>Push as much filtering and aggregation as possible into SQL so that Python only receives the reduced, relevant data.</li>
            <li>Work with sampled subsets for rapid prototyping, then scale to full data once the logic is validated.</li>
            <li>Use chunked processing and vectorized operations in pandas instead of row-by-row loops.</li>
            <li>Cache intermediate results (for example, summary tables) to avoid recomputing heavy transformations repeatedly.</li>
          </ul>
          These approaches have helped keep workflows reliable and performant even when the raw data volume is large.

        <div class="answer">
          In a recent project, our team needed to design and evaluate an AI system that could make decisions in a multi-agent environment. I worked closely with other engineers and researchers to define the problem, understand the data we had, and design experiments.
          <br /><br />
          My role included:
          <ul>
            <li>Translating the high-level research idea into concrete data pipelines and model experiments in Python.</li>
            <li>Running experiments, logging metrics, and summarizing results so the team could quickly see what was working.</li>
            <li>Documenting the approach and sharing concise updates with the team, including trade-offs and next steps.</li>
          </ul>
          This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication, version control, and aligning technical work with the team’s shared goals.

          My approach is structured and hands-on:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with the overview:</strong> I first understand the problem the tool or technique is meant to solve and where it fits in the workflow.</li>
            <li><strong>Official docs & quickstart:</strong> I go through the official documentation, quickstart guides, or a short course to learn the core concepts and best practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Build a small, realistic example:</strong> I apply it to a small project or a subset of real data so I can see how it behaves in practice.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate and document:</strong> As I learn, I keep notes and code snippets, and I refactor the example into something reusable.</li>
            <li><strong>Share and get feedback:</strong> When possible, I share what I learned with teammates, which helps solidify my understanding and improve our shared practices.</li>
          </ol>
          This method helps me learn new tools quickly while staying grounded in real-world use cases.

          I am currently working as a Data Science / Machine Learning intern and compensated at an hourly intern rate. For a full-time Junior Data Scientist role, I am targeting a competitive package that reflects the market for early-career data professionals and the opportunity for growth and responsibility.
          <br /><br />
          Over the next five years, I see myself growing into a strong applied data scientist who can own end-to-end projects: understanding stakeholder requirements, designing data pipelines, building and evaluating models, and translating results into clear business impact. I hope to take on increasing responsibility, mentor newer team members, and contribute to building robust, data-informed decision-making processes in the organization.
